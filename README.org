* Foundation for my Nix + Emacs setup
[[https://circleci.com/gh/akirak/nixmacs-bootstrap][https://circleci.com/gh/akirak/nixmacs-bootstrap.svg?style=svg]]

This repository contains a script which automates the following tasks for installing Emacs:

1. Install [[https://nixos.org/nix/][Nix package manager]] if it is not installed yet.
2. Add the Nix channel of [[https://github.com/rycee/home-manager][home-manager]] to Nix.
2. Initialise =~/.emacs.d= and add the URL of [[https://github.com/akirak/emacs.d][my Emacs configuration]] as its remote repository.

It also contains a Docker image for a [[https://nixos.org][NixOS]] environment with the setup, which is used for automated testing of the Emacs configuration.
